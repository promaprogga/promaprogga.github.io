Hi! I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at SSCL. I did my undergrad with the top position in Computer Science and Engineering at UIU. My current research focuses on computer vision and language. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:phprogga@gmail.com) if you are interested in my work.

- We propose VQAScore, the state-of-the-art alignment metric for text-to-image/video/3D models.
- VQAScore based on our new CLIP-FlanT5 model outperforms previous metrics based on GPT-4Vision or costly human feedback.

# üéñ Honors and Awards
- **Summa Cum Laude** - *United International University (2024)*
- **100% Scholarship** - *United International University (2019-2023)*
  - I have been awarded a 100% scholarship for excellent academic performance in 10 out of 12 trimesters, which are given to the top 2% of students in specific programs.
- **1st place in Asia, 13th Globally** - *University Rover Challenge (2022)*
  - University Rover Challenge (URC) is the world's premier robotics competition (Utah, United States) where I was part of the science team. We developed a subsystem to categorize soil and rock samples into extant, extinct, or 'No Presence of Life'. The process involves identifying living microorganisms on the surface of the rock and a model to detect whether rock samples are extinct or NPL. Our research utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies and we also developed our own dataset.
- **1st Runner-Up** - *CSE Project Showcase, United International University (Spring 2022)*
  - Led and contributed significantly to the successful execution of the ["Protibaad"](https://github.com/promaprogga/Protibaad) social awareness project, resulting in a 1st runner-up position in the project showcase.
- **5th position** - *Bengali Automatic Speech Recognition (Kaggle Competition), DL Sprint - BUET CSE Fest (2022)*
  - Framework: PyTorch
  - Word Embedding model: BERT, Word2Vec
  - Language model: N-Gram (6-gram)
  - Dataset: Bengali Common Voice Speech
